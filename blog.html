                        <strong>Local Storage :</strong> The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually.The client  can only read local storage. There is no transfer of data to the server. There are fewer old browsers that support it<br><br>
                        <strong>Session Storage :</strong> The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.There is no transfer of data to the server.There are fewer old browsers that support it.

                        <strong>What is event loop? </strong> Event loop continuously observes the call stack and call back queue . when it is empty it transfers the very first task to the call stack from the call back queue. <br><br>
                        <strong>How it works? </strong><br>
                         1- Browser has superpowers that helps to the JS engine to execute some tasks, these superpowers include web API's such as console, location, DOM API(anything starts with document like document.get element ID), setTimeout (it's a timer in the browser), fetch()(it can fetch data from the remote server), and local storage(browsers can stores data locally)<br>
                         2- Callback functions and event handlers are first stored in the Web API environment and then transferred to the callback queue.<br>
                         3- Only the call back functions that come from Promises and mutation observers are stored in the Web API environment and then transferred to the microtask queue.<br>
                         4- Event loop continuously observes the call stack and call back queue . when it is empty it transfers the very first task to the call stack from the call back queue.<br>
                         3- Micro tasks are given priority over the tasks inside the callback queue by Event loop to send to the call stack.<br>

                        4- If return has nothing on the right side of it, will be undefind.<br>
                        5- Property that does not exists on an object will be undefind.<br>
                        6- Element that does not exists in an array will be undefind.<br>
                        7- If we delete any element from an array and try to find it, it will be undefind(dont do this use slice method).<br>
                        8- Set a value derectly to undefined (not recommended instead of using undefined we can use null).<br>
